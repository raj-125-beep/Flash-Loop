⚡ Flash-Loop — A Solana-Powered Auto Transaction System

Flash-Loop is a minimal decentralized web application built on Solana that enables seamless wallet connection using Phantom Wallet and executes instant peer-to-peer transactions on the Solana Devnet.
The project demonstrates Solana integration, wallet authentication, and basic on-chain transaction handling — perfect for hackathon-ready submissions.

🔗 Phantom Wallet Integration — Securely connect and disconnect your Solana wallet.
💸 Instant SOL Transfers — Send SOL between wallets directly from your browser.
🧩 Simple UI — Clean and minimal one-page dashboard.
🌐 Runs Locally or on Vercel — Works seamlessly with both localhost and hosted environments.
🧠 Hackathon-Ready Base — Bare-minimum Solana integration to expand into escrow, marketplaces, or automation.
